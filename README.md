A particle system which is a rewrite of http://jsfiddle.net/felixmc/f6LdQ/light/


See index.html for a demo.
Requires createjs: http://createjs.com

Issues:
*  Memory leaks:
  * Chrome plays nice
  * Opera might see some increase but generally plays nice.
  * Firefox goes OM NOM NOM and then dies.
  * Have not tried iexplorer as it won't run on my computer.
